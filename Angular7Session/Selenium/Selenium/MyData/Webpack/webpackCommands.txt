AMD module -> define and require

ES6 module -> import and export

as import statement is not recognized by the browser because browsesrs does not supports ES6 modules thats why we need
webpack

npm install --save-dev webpack

webpack-cli : npm install webpack-cli --save-dev

it will create dist folder and main.js which is the bungle file
